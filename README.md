## Rules
1. Update order is left to right, bottom to top
2. If an empty square is adjacent to exactly one plant, then that square will become a plant
3. If an empty square is adjacent to zero or more than one plant, that square will remain empty

## Export/Import
I'm making plans to allow you to import [from here](https://cursedsliver.github.io/Garden-calc-infinite-expansion/), but currently just don't have the time.
The current system allows you to save/import only from here.
